# TypeTest

## Idea / Curiousity 
I built this project initially using 🌟 Vanilla JavaScript. You can find the vanilla JavaScript version in the vanilla route of the application.
I then refactored using  ⚛️ React.js to showcase the power and efficiency of React.js library. You can find the React version in the react route of the application.

## 🚀 Features

- **New Typing Tests Every Time:** The app has lots of different texts to keep your practice interesting and challenging.
- **Spot Your Mistakes Easily:** If you type something wrong, it'll light up so you can see where you need to improve.
- **Summary After Each Test:** When you finish a test, you get a detailed report of your speed, score, and mistakes.
- **Keep Practicing:** You can start new tests over and over to keep getting better.
- **Nice and Simple Design:** The design is clean and easy to use, helping you focus on practicing.
